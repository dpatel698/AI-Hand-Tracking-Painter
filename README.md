# AI-Hand-Tracking-Painter

A Python virtual painting program that uses deep learning to recognize hand gestures and enables a user to draw on a webcam video. A fully connected neural network is trained to read landmark data points detected on hands in a video which maps to certain hand gestures. A finger-pointing hand gesture is then recognized to paint certain pixels on webcam video.
